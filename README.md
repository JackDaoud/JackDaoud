<h1 align="center">Hello 👋🏻</h1>

I'm Jack, a curious thinker with a passion for learning and evolving across different fields. I majored in philosophy, specialized in creative writing, and earned a certification in personal training. I'm currently earning dual master degrees in international business & business analytics.

I've recently grown fond of data analytics, and that's what brought me to the universe of Github & Kaggle.

Overview of my Github Stats:

When I'm not analyzing things, I enjoy reading philosophy and playing video games like RuneScape, League of Legends, or Valorant.

Meet *Elusivebeing*, my RuneScape champion!
